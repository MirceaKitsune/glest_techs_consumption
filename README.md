# Consumption faction for MegaGlest

Consumption faction for MegaGlest. Play as a medieval human settlement struggling to survive, or a group of man eating lizards feasting on people! Thank you to the MegaGlest project for providing the necessary assets.

# Instructions

1. Download and install MegaGlest for your platform from https://megaglest.org/download
2. Download or Git clone the Consumption tech from https://github.com/MirceaKitsune/glest_techs_consumption using either of the following methods:
 - Download: Get the latest Git snapshot as a zip from https://github.com/MirceaKitsune/glest_techs_consumption/archive/master.zip
 - Git clone (Windows): Install TortoiseGit from https://tortoisegit.org and use the clone option to clone https://github.com/MirceaKitsune/glest_techs_consumption.git
 - Git clone (Linux): Open a bash prompt and issue the command: git clone https://github.com/MirceaKitsune/glest_techs_consumption.git
3. Rename the cloned or extracted directory to just "consumption".
4. Navigate to "C:\...\megaglest\data\glest_game" or your MegaGlest user folder (eg: "C:\...\Saved Games\megaglest" for Windows). Move the "consumption" directory inside the "techs" subdirectory.
5. Start up MegaGlest and go to the custom game screen. "Consumption" should now be available as an option in the tech tree selector.
